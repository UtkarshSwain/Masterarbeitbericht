abstract="The maintenance, archiving and usage of the design drawings is cumbersome in physical form in different industries for longer period. It is hard to extract information by simple scanning of drawing sheets. Converting them to their digital formats such as Computer-Aided Design (CAD), with needed knowledge extraction can solve this problem. The conversion of these machine drawings to its digital form is a crucial challenge which requires advanced techniques. This research proposes an innovative methodology utilizing Deep Learning methods. The approach employs object detection model, such as Yolov7, Faster R-CNN, to detect physical drawing objects present in the images followed by, edge detection algorithms such as canny filter to extract and refine the identified lines from the drawing region and curve detection techniques to detect circle. Also ornaments (complex shapes) within the drawings are extracted. To ensure comprehensive conversion, an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tool is integrated to identify and extract the text elements from the drawings. The extracted data which includes the lines, shapes and text is consolidated and stored in a structured comma separated values (csv) file format. The accuracy and the efficiency of conversion is evaluated. Through this, conversion can be automated to help organizations enhance their productivity, facilitate seamless collaborations and preserve valuable design information in a digital format easily accessible. Overall, this study contributes to the advancement of CAD conversions, providing accurate results from the translating process. Future research can focus on handling diverse drawing types, enhanced accuracy in shape and line detection and extraction.",

abstract = {Abstract Creating a high-fidelity railroad station model to match the physical details of hundreds of tracks and switches is never a trivial task. The manual modeling approach often costs engineers significant efforts and constrains the generality and extensivity of many advanced methods. Taking advantage that many stations are drawn proportionally into two-dimensional drawing exchange format (DXF) files via state-of-the-art computer-aided design (CAD) techniques, this paper proposed an efficient solution to convert DXF files into meaningful station models. The proposed solution consists of two phases (1) converting graphic basic primitives without explicit engineering interpretations into recognizable railroad symbols and (2) modeling undirected railroad station graphs with necessary configurations such as endpoints and routes. The proposed solution is developed into a graphic user interface application with minimal user interactions and subsequently tested at several real-world passenger stations in Asia for its validity, productivity, and applicability.},

  abstract = {In designing safety-critical infrastructures s.a. railway systems, engineers often have to deal with complex and large-scale designs. Formal methods can play an important role in helping automate various tasks. For railway designs formal methods have mainly been used to verify the safety of so-called interlockings through model checking, which deals with state change and rather complex properties, usually incurring considerable computational burden (e.g., the state-space explosion problem). In contrast, we focus on static infrastructure models, and are interested in checking requirements coming from design guidelines and regulations, as usually given by railway authorities or safety certification bodies. Our goal is to automate the tedious manual work that railway engineers do when ensuring compliance with regulations, through using software that is fast enough to do verification on-the-fly, thus being able to be included in the railway design tools, much like a compiler in an IDE. In consequence, this paper describes the integration into the railway design process of formal methods for automatically extracting railway models from the CAD railway designs and for describing relevant technical regulations and expert knowledge as properties to be checked on the models. We employ a variant of Datalog and use the standardized "railway markup language" railML as basis and exchange format for the formalization. We developed a prototype tool and integrated it in industrial railway CAD software, developed under the name RailCOMPLETE®. This on-the-fly verification tool is a help for the engineer while doing the designs, and is not a replacement to other more heavy-weight software like for doing interlocking verification or capacity analysis. Our tool, through the export into railML, can be easily integrated with these other tools. We apply our tool chain in a Norwegian railway project, the upgrade of the Arna railway station.},

abstract = {To support the sharing and reuse of formally represented knowledge among AI systems, it is useful to define the common vocabulary in which shared knowledge is represented. A specification of a representational vocabulary for a shared domain of discourse—definitions of classes, relations, functions, and other objects—is called an ontology. This paper describes a mechanism for defining ontologies that are portable over representation systems. Definitions written in a standard format for predicate calculus are translated by a system called Ontolingua into specialized representations, including frame-based systems as well as relational languages. This allows researchers to share and reuse ontologies, while retaining the computational benefits of specialized implementations. We discuss how the translation approach to portability addresses several technical problems. One problem is how to accommodate the stylistic and organizational differences among representations while preserving declarative content. Another is how to translate from a very expressive language into restricted languages, remaining system-independent while preserving the computational efficiency of implemented systems. We describe how these problems are addressed by basing Ontolingua itself on an ontology of domain-independent, representational idioms.}

abstract = {A new method is presented for adaptive document image binarization, where the page is considered as a collection of subcomponents such as text, background and picture. The problems caused by noise, illumination and many source type-related degradations are addressed. Two new algorithms are applied to determine a local threshold for each pixel. The performance evaluation of the algorithm utilizes test images with ground-truth, evaluation metrics for binarization of textual and synthetic images, and a weight-based ranking procedure for the final result presentation. The proposed algorithms were tested with images including different types of document components and degradations. The results were compared with a number of known techniques in the literature. The benchmarking results show that the method adapts and performs well in each case qualitatively and quantitatively.}

In response to the first problem, efficient pattern-matching and n-gram analysis techniques have been developed for detecting strings that do not appear in a given word list. In response to the second problem, a variety of general and application-specific spelling correction techniques have been developed. Some of them were based on detailed studies of spelling error patterns. In response to the third problem, a few experiments using natural-language-processing tools or statistical-language models have been carried out. This article surveys documented findings on spelling error patterns, provides descriptions of various nonword detection and isolated-word error correction techniques, reviews the state of the art of context-dependent word correction techniques, and discusses research issues related to all three areas of automatic error correction in text.},

QR tries to make explicit our everyday commonsense knowledge about the physical world and also the underlying abstractions used by scientists and engineers when they create models. Given this kind of knowledge and appropriate reasoning methods, a computer could make predictions and diagnoses and explain the behavior of physical systems in a qualitative manner, even when a precise quantitative description is not available or is computationally intractable. Note that a representation is not normally deemed to be qualitative by the QR community simply because it is symbolic and utilizes discrete quantity spaces but because the distinctions made in these discretizations are relevant to high-level descriptions of the system or behavior being modeled.",

abstract = {Automatic transformation of paper documents into electronic documents requires geometric document layout analysis at the first stage. However, variations in character font sizes, text line spacing, and document layout structures have made it difficult to design a general-purpose document layout analysis algorithm for many years. The use of some parameters has therefore been unavoidable in previous methods. In this paper, we propose a parameter-free method for segmenting the document images into maximal homogeneous regions and identifying them as texts, images, tables, and ruling lines. A pyramidal quadtree structure is constructed for multiscale analysis and a periodicity measure is suggested to find a periodical attribute of text regions for page segmentation. To obtain robust page segmentation results, a confirmation procedure using texture analysis is applied to only ambiguous regions. Based on the proposed periodicity measure, multiscale analysis, and confirmation procedure, we could develop a robust method for geometric document layout analysis independent of character font sizes, text line spacing, and document layout structures. The proposed method was experimented with the document database from the University of Washington and the MediaTeam Document Database. The results of these tests have shown that the proposed method provides more accurate results than the previous ones.},

It is based on Kruskal's algorithm and uses a special distance-metric between the components to construct the physical page structure. The method has all the major advantages of bottom-up systems: independence from different text spacing and independence from different block alignments. The algorithms computational complexity is reduced to linear by using heuristics and path-compression.},

The two levels of constraint were introduced to deal with the non bijective matching between segmented regions of an image and the nodes of a conceptual graph describing the semantic content of the image. This new system of spatial relations allows to build conceptual graphs describing more precisely the spatial relations between subparts of a composite object that we look for in an image. For example, it allows to express complex spatial relations such as “is surrounded by”. This approach can be applied to image interpretation and some examples on real images are presented.}
